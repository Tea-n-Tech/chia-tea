// Update Event describes the incremental change of ComputerInfo
// 
// Context:
//   Since ComputerInfo represents the whole state, it is also quite
//   heavy. It does not make sense to send the whole state of a computer
//   containing possibly thousands of entries such as plots every few seconds.
// 
// Technical Details:
//   The monitoring client collects a new ComputerInfo every few seconds depending 
//   on the config. It then compares the old and new ComputerInfo and creates the 
//   corresponding UpdateEvent in case of deviations. These events are then sent
//   to the server. There is a throttle for data which always changes such as CPU 
//   in the config. The names in the config under 'monitoring.client.send_data_every' 
//   are the same names as found in 'event_data'.
// 
// Constraints:
//   UpdateEvent must have the very same entries such as ComputerInfo but 
//   without the attribute 'repeated'. Only the types need to match but not
//   the names.
