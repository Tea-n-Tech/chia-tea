# Why Chia-Tea?

First and most important we love tea üçµ and we are not talking about that heartless, average stuff. We talk about tea with full-hearted passion and character in it. In this way we also love to craft software.

Second, we started the library from a single utility script to maintain our hobby chia farm. The project grew over time into a fully fledged chia library. Since we found it especially hard to keep track of our infrastructure, we designed a monitoring solution for our farm.

## What are important commands for Chia-Tea?

In `Taskfile.yml` you can find commands how to use the library. [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) is a modern replacement for Makefiles and we use it to store commands. We recommend to try it yourself. After the installation simply go into the project root and run

```bash
task
```

to see all commands.

## What can the discord bot do?

Notify on:

- [x] Farmer: Harvester connection/disconnection
- [x] Harvester timeouts
- [x] Harvester looses plots
- [x] Harvester: Notify if reward found
- [x] Wallet connects/disconnects
- [x] Wallet syncing or loosing sync
- [x] Computer has full RAM
- [x] Computer looses a disk

Commands:

- [x] `$machines`: short info about all machines known to the monitoring
- [x] `$harvesters`: reports the status of all connected harvesters
- [x] `$wallets`: reports the status of all wallets
- [x] `$farmers`: reports the status of all farmers

# How does the monitoring work?

Reconsider the structure of this repository

![Chia-Tea Infrastructure](Chia_Infrastructure.png?raw=true)

In both use scenarios, you in total need three programs to run:

- client: collects all data on a machine
- server: receives all data from connected machines and stores it
- discord bot: provides interaction with the database

On a single machine setup you will run every task on this particular machine. If you are running a multiple machine setup you can run the monitoring and server task on one machine whereas on all other machines you will run the client task.

## Client

To collect data from a system simply run the client on the very same machine. It collects data from automatically and send it to the server. This is a lot of information ranging from down-to-earth ram usage to checks if e.g. a farmer is running to information about every plot of a harvester.

## Server

The server receives the client data and writes it into a database file. This database file stores all events which ever happened. You can use this database to build anything on top, such as a dashboard.

## Discord Bot

Our discord bot watches the database for changes and provides notifications in case something is up. For example if you loose a drive with plots on or if the wallet is not synced anymore. Also there are commands to check on the status of different things.

# What data is being collected?

Briefly answered, everything relevant. Hardware information such as CPU, RAM, Disks but also system rsources such as chia specific processes. We don't monitor absolutely everything (we value a healthy privacy). If nothing specific to chia is present on the system the monitoring will simply omit this data.
